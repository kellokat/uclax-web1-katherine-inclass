        <h1>My In Class Homework</h1>
        
        <h2 class="new">01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, and JS are used together to create websites.  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is a programming language used for webpages.  Web browsers take the markup and use it to display text, images and content in a web page.  It is used to specify the content of web pages.</li>

            <li>This is different from CSS.  CSS is the Cascading Style Sheet. An HTML document is styled using this language.  In other words, the CSS contains the styling language for the web page.  Each attribute has its own title and can be specifically written to produce specific colors and fonts.  It is also used to configure layouts.</li>
        
            <li>JS deals with scripting.  HTML and CSS don’t.  JS stands for Javascript.  It is a scripting programming language for the web and deals with the behavior of the website. Content created with it runs on the web browser.  Without Javascript, most of the content or functionality on the web page would be useless.  It is the scripting programming language that creates dynamic content for a web site.</li>
        
        <li>While HTML specifies the content, CSS specifies the styling.  JS is used to program the behaviors and actions of the web page.  They are used together to create a website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>02.  What are single page apps (SPAs)?  How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Single page applications, also known as SPAs, run on one page of the website.  Code is rewritten based on the user’s choices within the webpage.  The advantage of single page applications is that the content does not have to reload every time the user makes a selection.</li>

                <li>All sources, from HTML to JS and CSS and any other data from the web server is loaded instantly, while the page itself does not reload.</li> 

                <li>Websites, therefore, feel more like native applications, rather than the traditional loading of basic HTML, JS and CSS.  This gives the website a dynamic feel and enhances the user’s experience. </li>

                <li>In multi-page websites, the user clicks links that navigate to different pages and subpages.  This means new data is loaded in a brand new page.  All the content must reload each time the user clicks a link.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>03.  What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A Web Designer designs the website. They create the look of the website.</li>

                <li>The Front End Developer deals with the coding of the site.  The Front End Developer uses coding languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript to implement what the Web Designer designs.  He or she codes the behavior of the website and works with a UX Designer.</li>

                <li>The Back End Developer programs the back-end of the website.  He or she creates the core computational logic of the website.  The user clicks components and features the back-end developer programs and creates.  He or she deals with security, they can't let anyone in who doesn't belong there, also, Web Services and APIS.</li>
                
            </ul>
           
            <h2>Distinguish the difference between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths.</h2>
                <li>Site Relative always starts with a forward slash '/path/to/file.' They are root relative, the path for the site's root folder for a document. This is more fexible because it will work on any server.</li>
                <li>Document Relative is for more specific documents within the directories.  It's a link relative to the file you are working with.  They are self-contained "islands."  This is the most flexible.</li>
                <li>In Absolute Paths, the whole address is used including the domain name. If you move to a new domain, there will be problems.  It is absolute because it is attached to a particular domain.  Sometimes you want to use them because you are linking to another website.</li>

            <h2>Final Project Description</h2>
                <li>For my Final Project, I want to create a website featuring unique custom handbags and accesories from around the world.  At first, I want the pieces to be standard, meaning I will simply sell the handbag makers own creation.  However, in the future I’d like to let the user choose their own fabric and accessories, for a custom bag.  But for now, I want to create a marketplace for unique handbags.</li>

                <li>I am the client. I want to sell one of a kind handbags to women everywhere.  Its purpose is to sell handbags women can’t find anywhere else.</li>
                    
                <li>I chose this subject because I have a friend who makes by hand really gorgeous bags using materials I haven’t seen before. I have another friend who is from South Africa and she knows someone who makes beautiful leather bags there. Run of the mill handbags are sold everywhere ranging from $10 to $10,000 and beyond. Women need handbags and they use them to display their style and personality at a reasonable price.</li>
                
                <h2>What it means for a company to be Agile. What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons.</h2>

                <li>Agile is used in software development. For a company to be Agile, there must be a team who works together to get the project done. Rather than working on the whole project at one time, sections, also called Sprints, are dealt with so that the project moves forward efficiently.  The work is iterative, lightening the amount of re-work that takes place.</li>

                <li>Agile development creates better control over the project.  It also reinforces team efficiency, flexibility, adaptability,and scalability.  Cost estimates are more precise and the project and the team are always evolving.  Change can easily take place at any time.</li>

                <li>One disadvantage is that everyone needs to be on the same page.  If not, bad behaviors can make the project suffer. Another is less predicatability, if you are working on small facets of the project at one time, sometimes the overall view becomes foggy. Agile Development also takes more time and commitment with a lot of demand on the team and the client. And the project can also lose it's focus and fall off track. </li>

                <h2>Define the following roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</h2>
                
                <li>The Project Manager oversees every aspect of the work that is being done on the project.  The Project Manager plans, procures and executes the project's goals.</li>

                <li>The Business Analyst is a person in a business or organization that analyses, records and documents the ongoing business processes.  They use data analysis to improve the project.</li>
                
                <li>The Scrum Master uses the Scrum Guide to establish Scrum, which is an agile framework for software development for teams to work together.  They use their knowledge of Scrum to guide the Scrum Team and organization.  He or she manages the team and is held accountable for their productivity.</li>
                
                <li>The UX designer determines the experience of the user, and makes the product useful.  They have many responsibilities such as product research, creating personas, idenitfying key user groups, Information Architecture, creating wireframes, prototyping, and product testing.</li>
                
                <li>The Web Developer/Engineer is a programmer for the creation of websites and apps on the internet. They create applications that use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  And in the server, they use PHP, ASP.NET, Python, Go or Java.  For the client and the server to communicate, they use http.</li>
                
                <li>The Quality Assurance Tester ensures the level of quality of the app or website that is being developed.  They focus on making the software development process better and making everything work under the quality standards of software products. They test the app and detail any bugs they find.</li>
                
                <li>DevOps stands for development and operations.  People, processes, and technology are united together to provide a valuable experience for the user.  Teams using DevOps create better apps and websites for the user's experience. It's the engineer who handles the architecture and deployment.</li>

                <h2>What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?</h2>

                <li>A jpg is a digital image that uses lossy compression to reduce file size.  While most digital images achieve 10:1 compression, the image quality is not greatly reduced. Jpg is the most popular image commpression and is used throughout the internet.</li>

                <li>A gif is a bitmap image format, supporting 8 bits per pixel and has its own color palette using up to 256 colors.  Gifs use Lempel-Ziv-Welch lossless data compression.  The images are not realistic and are used for graphics or logos.</li>

                <li>PNGs have lossless data compression and are a raster-graphics file format.  It was developed to replace GIFs.  PNGs can have transparent backgrounds and can use palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors.</li>

                <li>SVG images are used for 2d graphic and use an Extensive Markup Language (XML)-based vector image format.  XML text files determine the SVG image's behaviors. A standard text editor can be used to create and edit the SVG images.  There are three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes, bitmap images and text and they use CSS and JavaScript. Data compression varies, but SVG images can achieve lossless data compression.</li>
